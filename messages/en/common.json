    "p8": "Building an eCommerce website isn’t as simple as choosing a CMS and adding your products one by one. The scale of your online store – from the amount of customers you expect to have to the amount of products you sell – will influence your choices regarding software, payment processing, and other factors.",
    "p9": "Before you start developing your eCommerce website, you need to have a full plan and development schedule prepared. As part of this process, you’ll need to answer several questions, each of which will have an effect on your decisions.",

    "p10": "How many products do you plan to sell on your website? Does your company only have two or three different products to sell, or do you have hundreds or thousands of different products for customers to choose from?",
    "p11": "The scale of your store has a huge effect on your choice of software. Small online stores can often be built using content management systems like WordPress and Twitter Bootstrap, while large stores generally need to use dedicated software.",
    "p12": "When you calculate the total number of products you plan to sell, you also need to take variants into account. If you sell shoes, for example, each size and color should count as a separate product for the purpose of calculating your website’s scale.",
    "p13": "This can often mean that a clothing store with what seems like hundreds of shirts, shoes, or other products can really have thousands of unique items which are sold online. Each of these products needs its own unique stock keeping unit (SKU).",
    "p14": "Finally, the scale of your eCommerce website extends to categories. Do you sell just one type of product – for example, a shoe store – or do you sell hundreds of types of products, like a department store? The more categories, the larger the scale.",
    "title5": "Choosing a development framework",
    "p15": "If your eCommerce website is relatively small, with less than 50 unique products, it can often be built using a content management system like WordPress and various plugins dedicated to product management, checkouts, and online payments.",

    "p18": "Magento offers numerous advantages that WordPress and third-party eCommerce plugins simply can’t match. It’s built from the ground up for large online stores, and is easy to customize and operate.",
    "p19": "It’s also much more powerful than any content-focused CMS. While WordPress is an extremely flexible platform for online publishing, it’s far from ideal for developing a product-focused online store.",
    "p20": "Are you developing a large online store with hundreds of products? Enroll in our course, MAGENTO Scratch: Open Your First Shop Online, to learn how you can use this powerful open source application to build your first eCommerce website.",

    "p22": "Whether you sell stylish clothing or automotive toolkits, the fundamentals of your eCommerce website will mostly be the same. Navigation bars, product categories, and backend databases are similar in structure on most eCommerce websites.",
    "p23": "However, you have a great deal of creative control over the way your product pages look. Many eCommerce websites include features like user reviews, product options, and even demonstration videos. As part of your eCommerce website development plan, you’ll need to think carefully about how your product page should look.",

    "p27": "Learn more about planning and executing a web development project in our course,The Basics of Project Planning. Go over all of the factors listed above – from payment processing to on-site design – and build a detailed, actionable development plan.",
    "p28": "For most eCommerce website development projects, you’ll need a team of skilled and capable people with experience developing using WordPress or Magento. It’s often more cost-effective to outsource aspects of your online store’s development.",
    "p29": "Our course, Use Outsourcing to be More Productive & More Profitable, shows you the keys to successful development outsourcing. From design to code to the final product, it’s possible to outsource every aspect of your website’s development.",
